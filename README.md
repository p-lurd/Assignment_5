Assignment: Database


Context
Company X wants us to build their next product. This product is an inventory management system and they want us to provide database information before building the application.

They have items/products they are willing to sell or use within their organization. They would like admins to be able to create, update, view and delete items but other users can only see items. Users can only place orders on these items and admins get to approve or disapprove these orders. Every item has its own category.

Items can have name, price, size, a category, and other things you as the developer have in mind
Size can either be small, medium or large
We can have as many categories as we would like, but every item must belong to a category


What you need to do:
Using any ERD tool of your choice, create a database design for the above problem
Create an SQL script that shows:
creation of all the entities
Show commands for inserting records into the entities
Show commands for getting records from two or more entities
Show commands for updating records from two or more entities
Show commands for deleting records from two or more entities
Create a NoSQL script the shows:
creation of all the entities
Show commands for inserting records into the entities
Show commands for getting records from two or more entities
Show commands for updating records from two or more entities
Show commands for deleting records from two or more entities


Things to NOTE:
File format to be submitted for SQL is {yourFileName}.sql
File format to be submitted for NoSQL(mongodb) is {yourFileName}.js
Upload both files to a git repository for submission
Also, ensure your ERD tool is public as you would be submitting the link
